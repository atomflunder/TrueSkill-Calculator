## How to use

## Why?

The original, official TrueSkill calculator by Microsoft seems to have gone offline in 2018 and I could not find a good replacement. [Link to Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/http://boson.research.microsoft.com:80/trueskill/rankcalculator.aspx).  
So, I decided to create my own.
